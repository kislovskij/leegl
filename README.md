# Long Terms. Short Version.

No one reads the fine print - because major online services don't want you to read them. The internet is a really scary place if you are aware of what you agreed on. We need to change that. By offering transparent overviews of what the terms really are â€“ implemented directly into the registration process. By doing so we force online platforms to change something about their fine print. So that in future you don't need to accept "basically everything".
